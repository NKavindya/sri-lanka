            buffs.

            A tropical climate all year round
        </div>
        <div class="visit">
            Sri Lanka experiences two monsoon seasons, which affect different parts of the country during different
            months. This means that, at any given time, travellers can expect a sunny climate somewhere on the
            island.
            The southwest monsoon is between May and July, which leaves the north rain-free, and the northeast
            monsoon
            is between October and January, which leaves the south ready to be explored.

            Make the most of the weather with a stay at one of the best luxury hotels in Sri Lanka.

            Amazing food
        </div>
        <div class="visit">
            Sri Lanka is blessed with a distinctive cuisine flavoured with exotic spices. The famed rice and curry
            spread includes an intense and fragrant lentil and chicken or fish curry with rice and vegetables on the
            side. The fish curry is highly recommended by locals. Kottu is a popular street food of Tamil origin
            with
            chopped roti flatbread and usually egg, meat, vegetables and salna — a spicy sauce on the side. Make
            sure
            you try egg hoppers too.

            Rare land animals
        </div>
        <div class="visit">
            Sri Lanka has 26 national parks and two marine parks. The most well known, Yala National Park, has the
            highest density of leopards in the world, 215 species of bird, mugger crocodiles and other reptiles,
            while
            the coastline bordering the park is a nesting spot for five species of sea turtle. Adjacent to Yala is
            Udawalawe National Park, home to herds of elephants and rare birds such as the changeable hawk-eagle and
            the serpent eagle.
            Pigeon Island attracts many travellers looking to experience the marine life surrounding the island. The
            reef off the island consists of about 100 species of colourful corals and up to 300 species of reef
            fish, making snorkelling in these waters an incredible experience.

            Glorious beaches

        <div class="visit">
            Sri Lanka has some of the most pristine coastline in Asia, with many unspoiled sandy beaches with palm
            trees and turquoise waters. Head to Mirissa if you’d like to soak up the sun in peace, while Unawatuna
            is better suited for those in the mood for beach parties. For adrenaline junkies, Bentota, with water
            activities such as kitesurfing and para-cycling, is the place to be.

            Make sure you check out the best beach resorts in Sri Lanka to help you decide where to stay.

            Whales and dolphins
        </div>
        <div class="visit">
            Sri Lanka is probably the only place in the world where you can view a species of both the world’s
            largest land mammal, the elephant, and the largest water mammal, the blue whale. Five species of whale,
            including the blue whale and the minke whale, are regularly seen in the seas off Kalpitiya. If you’re
            lucky, you’ll be able to spot spinner dolphins too. The peak months for whale watching in Kalpitiya are
            between January and March.

            Gorgeous landscapes and hiking trails
        </div>
        <div class="visit">
            Sri Lanka’s abundance of flora and fauna means it has beautiful nature trails, with stunning vistas and
            waterfalls, misty mountains rising into the clouds, hillsides covered with paddy fields and tea estates
            and the occasional peacock or deer crossing your path. For beginners, the Demodara Rail Hike in Ella is
            a great option that takes hikers past Nine Arches Bridge, a colonial-era viaduct. More experienced
            hikers should consider going to Kirigalpotha or the Knuckles Mountain Range, widely regarded as the most
            beautiful hiking trail in the country.

            To make the most of all the things to do in Ella, you should book a stay at one of these hand-picked
            hotels.

            Super surfing

        <div class="visit">
            Easy access to the waves, the great number of sand-bottom breaks and the ever-consistent swells have
            made Sri Lanka a popular surfing destination. Arugam Bay is arguably the best spot for surfing and
            regularly hosts international competitions such as Red Bull Ride My Wave. Not only does it have the best
            swells, but the wide range of choices means there are plenty of options for both novices and experienced
            surfers. Many other coastal towns, such as Hikkaduwa, offer great surfing opportunities too.

            traveller.

            Millennia of Buddhist heritage

        <div class="visit">
            Buddhism has played a key role here over the centuries and there are several ancient temples dotted
            throughout Sri Lanka. These ancient places of worship often feature inspiring architecture and designs
            that were far ahead of their times. The most well-known example is the Temple of the Tooth, though the
            Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi (a sacred fig tree in Anuradhapur) and the Ruwanwelisaya stupa, are also
            must-visits.

            Intriguing colonial history

        <div class="visit">
            Dubbed Little England, Nuwara Eliya is a sleepy town in the tea country hills of central Sri Lanka. Full
            of colonial-era buildings and bungalows, Tudor-style hotels and well-manicured hedges and gardens,
            Nuwara Eliya gives the impression of a town from a bygone era and though small, it offers plenty to see
            and do. You can drop by the massive Gregory Lake for water activities and a lakeside barbecue, or visit
            Horton Plains, a beautiful grassland with rolling plains, waterfalls and the dramatic escarpment known
            as World’s End.

            A stay in the 19th-century Grand Hotel in Nuwara Eliya is recommended.

            During the months of May to September, the retreating banks of a 1,700-year-old reservoir make for the
            most astonishing sight. Around 400 Asian elephants gather by the lake at Minneriya National Park to
            feed, socialise and frolic in the water. It is thought to be the largest gathering of this species of
            elephant in the world. The park has plenty more to see in the form of deer, purple-faced langur monkeys
            and a variety of birdlife.

            The Cultural Triangle
        </div>
        <div class="visit">
            The Cultural Triangle is a trove of ancient cities, relics and religious monuments showcasing early Sri
            Lankan civilisation. The triangle consists of the area between three cities – Kandy, Anuradhapura and
            Polonnaruwa. Visitors can find Sigiriya, an ancient rock fortress, the cave temples of Dambulla and
            Mihintale, which is the birthplace of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. There are also lesser-known but culturally
            important attractions such as Yapahuwa, a medieval citadel which was briefly the capital of Sri Lanka in
            the 13th century.

            There are a range of places to stay in the Cultural Triangle, from boutique hotels in Kandy to hotels in
            Dambulla.
